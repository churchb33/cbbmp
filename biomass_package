#' Hi, Gregor!
#' 
#' 
#' The purpose of the package is to provide biomass data for species taxa (Baltic tellin clam 
#' by default) and some paired water quality and sediment parameters. Also, the package
#' provides functions for downloading new biomass data for specific species, years, etc.,
#' as well as tools for graphing and statistical analysis.
#'  
#' 
#' The data was collected as part of the Chesapeake Bay Benthic Monitoring Program
#' in Maryland and Virginia starting in 1995. Data is available through 2013 currently,
#' although the default dataset associated with the biomass package is from 1995 to 2012.
